            <h2 class="content-heading">The Problem</h2>
            <p class="content-text">
                Arctic Travels is a premium travel agency specialising in tailor made skiing and snowboarding holidays. Despite offering high end experiences, their digital presence did not reflect the luxury, clarity, or ease of booking that their audience expects.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                The existing process lacked visual inspiration, intuitive navigation, and trust building information which made it difficult for users to confidently plan and book their trips.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-block">
            <h2 class="content-heading">The Solution</h2>
            <p class="content-text">
                The goal was to deliver a polished, intuitive, and trustworthy booking experience that balances luxury aesthetic with practical usability, to allow users to feel confident as they plan their bespoke ski holiday.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                Specifically the client wanted inspiring photographs, a cool-toned palette and bold call-to-action buttons (CTAs). With inspiration drawn from sites like Booking.com and Expedia for the landing page and user experience.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                My design process followed the Double Diamond framework, grounding every decision in user research and iterative testing to deliver a premium, intuitive booking experience
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                Through user interviews and competitor analysis, I identified common frustrations in mainstream travel sites which included cluttered layouts, hidden fees, and overwhelming upsells. I addressed these directly by simplifying the search interface, limiting options per screen to reduce cognitive load, and applying Hick's Law to present only essential choices at each stage.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                I introduced a side by side trip summary to increase pricing transparency, and contextual upgrades appeared only after users confirmed their core booking which enhanced trust and prevented decision fatigue.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                To maintain a consistent premium feel, I implemented a cool-toned colour palette, immersive photography, and bold CTAs that guided users clearly through their journey. The layout and typography were optimised for both desktop and mobile, with responsive adjustments ensuring balance and readability across devices.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                The final design transforms complex trip planning into a confident, effortless experience, combining luxury, clarity, and usability to make bespoke ski holidays feel both aspirational and achievable.

                Following the brief, user research and personas, I understood that my target audience was likely to be those aged 25-55 years old who enjoy adventurous luxury winter holidays that are well priced, visually appealing and easy to book. With this in mind I aimed to create a polished, modern interface that provides professional guidance for a seamless booking process.

                        The client requested cool-toned colours to reflect typical ski holiday branding. I used an analogous palette of blues and greens with neutral tones for balance and accessibility.

                    <p class="content-text">

                        #767778 / #CCD3D9 – greys for contrast and structure.

                        For the typefaces, I wanted to balance luxury with functionality. Script fonts felt elegant but were hard to read, so I ruled them out. I first explored serif options like Cinzel Decorative Bold for headlines and EB Garamond Regular for body text, which conveyed trust and sophistication. I then tested sans-serif options for better digital clarity, including Montserrat and Bruno Ace, paired with Open Sans for readability. Ultimately, the clean, modern pairing of Bruno Ace and Open Sans best reflected a refined yet user-friendly aesthetic suited to a luxury travel brand.

                        In line with the brief, the client wanted a landing page similar to Expedia or Booking.com, following Jakob's Law that users prefer familiar designs.

I applied these principles across the destination and booking pages, ensuring a consistent, intuitive experience for users planning their ski holiday.

            <p class="content-text">
                Before developing any interfaces for Arctic Travels, I created a clear Information Architecture (IA) and User Flow to establish how users would navigate through the platform and complete key tasks such as searching for lodges, making a booking, or managing their account. This allowed me to anticipate user needs, map out critical interactions, and structure the site in a way that reduced friction and increased clarity.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                The IA ensures content is organised in a logical structure that mirrors how users think about planning a ski holiday starting with destinations, narrowing to resorts, then viewing lodges. This reduces cognitive load, so users don't have to guess where to go next.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-block">
            <p class="content-text">
                The IA was structured around four main user goals:
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                1. Discover ski holidays and extras (via regions, resorts, lodges, passes or special offers)

                As users often browse of their mobiles, I made the CTAs tap-friendly and collapsible menus to allow for ease when scrolling and readability to ensure the interface was mobile responsive. As well as filters to optimise searches and create a streamlined process.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                Another key focus was to make the visual hierarchy clear as users want quick access to options that matter to them. To do this, I highlighted the regions, resorts, lodges and passes on the front page and created filters for searching, including within spotlight offers so that it would stand out.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                I created an intuitive navigation based on my information architecture and user flow to allow users to move seamlessly from browsing to booking and confirmation.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                Whilst I wanted to focus on the imagery, I needed to ensure that the interfaces did not feel cluttered as I found this was common in my user research. I avoided this on mobile by using stacking and carousels to filter through content. I avoided this on desktop by using hierarchy and white space appropriately.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                From my user research, I wanted to include upsells. To achieve this, I placed upsells on the confirmation page with the title "enhance your trip" to make it feel optional and contextual, rather than aggressive. It also added a sense of luxury as opposed to just displaying it as an add-on.

                To guarantee visual coherence and accelerate hand off between a design team, I compiled a design system that documents every foundational choice behind the Arctic Travels interface. I also chose typography that I had identified within my research.

            <h3 class="content-subheading">Successes</h3>
            <p class="content-text">
                One of the successes of this project was throughly undertaking user research to enhance my designs. The user research revealed several friction points in mainstream travel sites such as cluttered search pages, hidden fees, and generic upsells. By mapping those findings directly to my designs such as reducing the amount of options on search pages, including a side by side trip summary for transparency and contextual upgrades upon confirmation of the booking, I closed the gap between what users complain about and how my UI behaves.
            </p>

            <h3 class="content-subheading">Challenges</h3>
            <p class="content-text">
                One of the challenges of this project was dealing with the amount of content and ensuring that it translated well across both desktop and mobile. To ensure that both interfaces were optimised, I altered the layout and text content accordingly.
            </p>

            <h3 class="content-subheading">What I Learned</h3>
            <p class="content-text">
                Overall, the double diamond structured approach helped ensure that every design decision was rooted in user insight and aligned with Arctic Travels' business objectives and to understand the target users in order to translate a premium brand vision into a cohesive, user‑centred interface.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                By applying principles such as Hick's Law, I focused on reducing cognitive overload throughout the booking journey. This meant presenting users with clear, limited choices at each step, especially during key moments like selecting regions, lodging, or passes. By simplifying decision-making, the experience became more intuitive and efficient. The final design balances freedom and simplicity, empowering users to plan confidently without feeling overwhelmed.
