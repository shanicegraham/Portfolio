            <h2 class="content-heading">The Problem</h2>
            <p class="content-text">
                Artisan Bakery Co. lacked a dedicated digital presence, making it difficult for potential and existing customers to discover their products, engage with the brand, or access key information such as opening hours, product offerings, and location.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                In a digital-first world, especially for small local businesses, having a responsive and user-friendly website is essential for reaching their target audience, which is local residents and food enthusiasts who value quality and community.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-block">
            <h2 class="content-heading">The Solution</h2>
            <p class="content-text">
                Without a website, the bakery missed opportunities to showcase its handcrafted products, share its story, and build a loyal online customer base through digital orders. Therefore, a website was required to reflect the bakery's rustic, welcoming aesthetic, provide a seamless user experience across desktop and mobile, and communicate its core message: "Handcrafted. Heartfelt. Homegrown."
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                To help Artisan Bakery Co. establish a strong online presence, I designed a responsive website that captured the brand's rustic warmth while remaining functional and easy to navigate. I began by analysing the customer journey and mapping out key user flows to ensure browsing, story exploration, and ordering felt smooth across devices.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                To avoid overwhelming users with too much content, I structured the homepage into scrollable narrative sections such as "Inside the Bakery" and "Community Feedback", which balanced storytelling with clear product CTAs. This layout created a rhythm between emotion and action, encouraging engagement without clutter.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                I developed a consistent spacing and grid system to prevent layout inconsistencies and reduce unnecessary white space as new content was added. Responsive testing across devices helped fine-tune alignment, readability, and accessibility.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                Throughout the process, I iterated between wireframes and high-fidelity prototypes to test visual hierarchy and flow, ensuring every element supported the bakery's message: "Handcrafted. Heartfelt. Homegrown."
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                The final design translates the bakery's identity into a cohesive digital experience, balancing emotion and function through thoughtful storytelling, structure, and user-centred design.

            <p class="content-text">
                To kickstart the design process, my moodboard played a central role in discovering and guiding the aesthetic and functional direction of the Artisan Bakery Co. website. Thorough research allowed me to establish the tone that I was going to follow to illustrate the bakery's core values of handcrafted quality, community focus, and a welcoming, down-to-earth atmosphere.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                As an artisan bakery, my target audience is a wide range of customers within the local community, specifically families who crave fresh daily produce and foodies seeking high-quality products with local ingredients. Therefore, it was important to evoke a sense of welcoming in the design for the bakery.

        <div class="content-block">
            <h3 class="content-subheading">User Flow</h3>
            <p class="content-text">
                The user flow for the Artisan Bakery Co. website was carefully designed to define a logical, intuitive experience for users navigating the site. The user flow begins with the Home Page, branching into essential sections such as Search Product, See Menu, Order, Visit Us, About Us, and Contact Us. These top-level categories reflect typical user goals and ensure that both new and returning users can quickly find the information they need.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                The user flow guides visitors through key processes like browsing products, account management, and placing an order. Actions such as signing up, logging in, resetting passwords, and guest checkout are all mapped out in a way that minimises friction and decision fatigue. The checkout process is designed with flexibility, offering users options to log in, register, or proceed as a guest. Once in the cart, the flow moves through logical stages: billing, address confirmation, payment, and finally, order confirmation and tracking.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                Visually structuring the flow helped ensure the experience supports users at every step from discovering baked goods to completing a purchase, whilst also aligning with the bakery's emphasis on warmth and ease, ensuring that the digital experience mirrors the welcoming, handcrafted feel of the physical bakery.

            <h3 class="content-subheading">Wireframes</h3>
            <h4 class="content-minor-heading">Desktop</h4>
            <p class="content-text">
                As part of my design process, I chose to wireframe the desktop and mobile pages for the landing and menu pages for the website. In order to create the mid-fidelity wireframes, I began by defining the user goals, business objectives, and core content based on the brief. Each screen was planned to reflect the bakery's emphasis on handcrafted products in line with the user flow where the end goal is to purchase.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                I prioritised clear, consistent navigation, starting with a strong homepage that includes calls to action (CTAs) like Order, See Menu, and Visit Us. I structured the menu page by product categories (e.g., Pastries, Sweet Treats, Bread, Savouries), ensuring content was scannable and adaptable to mobile. This dual-device approach helped me consider responsive layout decisions early in the process.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                My main focus was to ensure that the products were highlighted and enticing to draw in new and existing users. This included using large product images and community feedback to provide credibility to the products.

            <h4 class="content-minor-heading">Mobile</h4>
            <p class="content-text">
                Wireframing is a critical part of the UX design process because it allows for fast iteration and feedback. It helped me clarify the flow of information and user journeys without getting distracted by visuals. This step allowed me to validate layout decisions, organise content hierarchically, and ensure accessibility and responsiveness before investing in full visual design or development.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                A challenge I faced was designing for mobile without overcrowding the screen and balancing the white space. I solved this by removing unnecessary white space on both the desktop and mobile pages, simplifying the mobile navigation with a collapsible menu, stacking content vertically, and ensuring all buttons (like "Order," "See More," and "Add to Cart") were thumb-accessible and clearly visible.

            <h2 class="content-heading">Design System</h2>
            <p class="content-text">
                A design system is a comprehensive collection of reusable components, guidelines, and assets that define the visual language and user interface elements of a digital product. It typically includes things like typography, colours, iconography, spacing, components (e.g., buttons, icons, forms), and layout grids.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                Design systems are essential for:
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                <strong>Consistency:</strong> Ensuring a unified look and feel across all pages and platforms (desktop and mobile).
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                <strong>Efficiency:</strong> Enabling faster design and development by reusing predefined components.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                <strong>Scalability:</strong> Supporting future growth without losing brand cohesion.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                <strong>Accessibility:</strong> Providing rules that help meet usability and inclusive design standards.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                For this project, I developed a full design system that visually reflects the brand's warm, handcrafted, and community-focused identity whilst maintaining modern usability principles. Here's a breakdown of its key components:
            </p>

        <div class="content-block">
            <h2 class="content-heading">Final Designs</h2>
            <p class="content-text">
                The goal of the final design was to bring Artisan Bakery Co.'s values to life. The website needed to feel warm, trustworthy, and locally rooted, while also being functional and easy to navigate for users who want to explore products, place orders, or learn about the bakery.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                I designed the final interfaces, ensuring that I kept the warm and rustic aesthetic by using a neutral colour palette (browns and beiges) and organic imagery to reflect the handcrafted nature of the bakery. I highlighted the products by using large imagery to draw the user's attention.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                I wanted to create a user-friendly shopping experience, so I chose clear product categorisation (Pastries, Sweet Treats, Bread, Savouries) on the menu page to support easy browsing and ordering.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                I included community-driven message sections like "Inside the Bakery", "Community Feedback", and "Rewards & Perks" to reinforce local engagement and loyalty.

        <div class="content-block">
            <p class="content-text">
                My final screens reflect my user flow, as I have clearly marked buttons such as "Order," "Visit Us," and "See Menu" on the homepage to direct users based on their goals. I also have product browsing to help users find specific items with options to add to cart directly from the product grid. Everything flows logically and intuitively, minimising friction.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                My final screens also reflect my wireframes, which were fundamental in ideating my final design. On both the landing and menu page, the grid layout for product cards with imagery, pricing, quantity selectors, and "Add to Cart" buttons was executed just as planned, with responsive stacking in mobile view to ensure each product remains readable and easy to interact with.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                Minor changes were made to the wireframes and final designs to remove unnecessary white space, to allow for seamless transfer between the elements across the interfaces and minimise user distraction.

            <h3 class="content-subheading">Challenges</h3>
            <p class="content-text">
                Avoiding an overwhelming product experience – To counteract this, I broke the homepage into clear, scrollable sections, allowing storytelling content like "Inside the Bakery" and "Community Feedback" to sit alongside product CTAs in a balanced, non-intrusive way.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                Unnecessary white space, especially as more content was added – To resolve this, I relied heavily on my spacing system, grid layouts, and text styles to keep everything aligned. Frequent testing across devices helped identify and fix any inconsistencies early.
