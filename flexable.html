            <h2 class="content-heading">The Problem</h2>
            <p class="content-text">
                Staying active is a challenge for many individuals living with physical, sensory, cognitive, or invisible disabilities, as most mainstream fitness apps are not designed with their needs in mind. While these apps offer tracking, community features, and workout libraries, they often lack accessibility, adaptive exercise options, and an encouraging tone. This leaves users feeling excluded, overwhelmed, or unable to find routines that genuinely work for them.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-block">
            <h2 class="content-heading">The Solution</h2>
            <p class="content-text">
                FlexAble is an accessible fitness tracker for individuals with disabilities who are seeking a healthy and active lifestyle. Its primary focus is to help individuals set goals, stay consistent and move at their own pace whilst empowering them.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                The goal was to create a fitness app that prioritises accessibility and inclusivity from the outset by offering personalised adaptive workouts, clear guidance, and flexible ways to track progress. By focusing on supportive feedback rather than competition, and ensuring that the interface is intuitive and accessible, the app empowers users to build confidence, stay active, and maintain healthy routines.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                As part of a collaborative group project, I carried out extensive competitor research that uncovered key pain points in mainstream fitness apps which were confusing layouts, lack of voice feedback, and limited adaptive workouts.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                Alongside the user research that my group carried out, I addressed these issues by simplifying the navigation, creating a clear hierarchy with minimal steps to reach workouts and progress tracking. The app offers adjustable workouts based on users' mobility levels, allowing them to customise duration, intensity, and exercise type. I also incorporated accessibility settings, including voice feedback, larger touch targets, and adjustable contrast modes to ensure usability across a wide range of abilities.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                I led the design of the homepage and fitness tracker, ensuring consistency through user personas, information architecture, and user flows. By aligning these frameworks early, we maintained a unified vision and avoided feature overload. Regular feedback sessions helped refine design decisions and maintain focus on user needs.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                Through this process, we created an app that is accessible, scalable, and empowering to encourage users to stay active at their own pace while building confidence and independence through thoughtful, inclusive design.

            <h3 class="content-subheading">User Research</h3>
            <p class="content-text">
                To gain a deeper understanding of our users, we adopted a mixed-methods approach that combined surveys, interviews, and competitor analysis.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                My team member conducted a survey with six participants living with disabilities provided both quantitative and qualitative insights into their fitness habits, accessibility challenges, and feature preferences. Our aim was to uncover their current behaviours, use of technology, and unmet needs in order to inform an inclusive design solution.
            </p>

        <div class="content-block">
            <p class="content-text">
                The findings demonstrated that every participant had encountered barriers when using mainstream fitness apps. Common issues ranged from confusing layouts to the absence of voice feedback, reinforcing the sense that accessibility remains an afterthought. Most users tracked their activity on their phones and preferred adaptable, low pressure routines such as walking, light strength training, or dance based mobility. What they sought above all were simpler interfaces, clear step by step guidance, and workouts that could be tailored to their individual needs. These insights not only revealed pain points but also shaped a clear direction for FlexAble.

            <p class="content-text">
                To complement our survey, we conducted interviews based on three participants, Zayn (amputee), Ayesha (partially sighted), and Rory (neurodivergent). These conversations offered deeper insight into the emotional and practical challenges users face when engaging with fitness apps, helping us shape FlexAble around real accessibility needs.

            <p class="content-text">
                To ensure our fitness app meets the needs of individuals with diverse abilities, I developed three detailed user personas based on targeted research and accessibility considerations. The personas of Zayn, Ayesha, and Rory represent key user groups with distinct physical, sensory, and cognitive needs.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                Each profile captures their needs &amp; expectations, interests &amp; goals, influences &amp; motivations and pain points &amp; frustrations, helping the design team empathise with real world challenges and make informed decisions throughout the design process.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                By grounding our solutions in the lived experiences of our personas, we aimed to create an inclusive, adaptable, and user centred fitness experience that empowers every individual to engage with physical activity on their own terms. I created the affinity map to synthesise insights from the three user personas and identify common themes across their accessibility needs, goals, frustrations, motivations, and preferred features. By clustering these insights, I could clearly see where user requirements overlapped and where unique considerations were needed for each persona.

            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                The biggest challenge during this phase was ensuring that all of the pages came together cohesively as the screens were divided amongst a few team members. During this stage, a lot of iteration occurred where I had to justify my design decisions to my team members and also review theirs. Ensuring that my design decisions were grounded with the user in mind assisted in justifying why they were appropriate.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                Applying design principles like Hick's Law helped reduce cognitive overload, particularly in onboarding flows. This ensured users faced limited, clear choices at each step, making the app feel more intuitive and less overwhelming.

            <h2 class="content-heading">Conclusion</h2>
            <p class="content-text">
                One of the key successes of this project was my contribution in carrying out thorough user research to guide our designs. The research highlighted major barriers in mainstream fitness apps, such as confusing layouts, lack of voice feedback, and limited adaptive workouts. By mapping these insights into the design such as simplifying the navigation, offering adjustable workouts, and building in accessibility settings, we created an app that closes the gap between what users struggle with and how our UI supports them.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                A major challenge in this project was designing for accessibility across a wide range of disabilities. It required balancing clarity and flexibility while ensuring the app didn't become overwhelming. Another challenge was working as part of a group, aligning different ideas and contributions into one consistent vision. To overcome this, I focused on pivotal areas such as competitor research, user personas, information architecture, user flows, and leading the design of the homepage and fitness tracker, ensuring cohesion and usability across the app. I requested feedback from my team throughout to assist in the ideation process.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
                This project also demonstrated the challenges and value of group collaboration, teaching me how to align multiple perspectives into a cohesive outcome. By focusing on accessibility-first design, iteration, and systematic thinking, we developed an app that is scalable, user-centred, and inclusive.
